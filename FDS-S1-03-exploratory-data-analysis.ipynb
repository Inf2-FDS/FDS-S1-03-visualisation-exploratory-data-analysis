    "## A. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.1 Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to use the power of visualisation to help you as the analyst learn as much as possible about the data quickly. In EDA, visualisations should be informative and insightful, and understandable by you and your close colleagues. However, they don't need to be very beautiful or polished - this  can wait to the data communication phase, which we'll cover in the next lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A.2 Tidy Data and the Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in the lecture on Data, in a tidy dataset, each column corresponds to a variable (or attribute) and each row corresponds to an instance or observation possessing each of the variables. Tidy data makes data exploration easy when paired with the \"[grammar of graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson%27s_Grammar_of_Graphics)\" approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar of graphics is a method of producing visualisations in which variables are mapped directly onto different aesthetic elements found in a visualisation. For example, we might want to map one variable to the x-axis, another to the y-axis and a third variable to the colour of whatever it is we are plotting. Don't worry if this abstract description is confusing - it should hopefully make more sense when you see some examples! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different visualisation libraries out there, the one we will use today is Seaborn. As always, this lab is not comprehensive and only covers a small portion of Seaborn's capability. It is recommended that you check out the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to find out more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't utilise the full grammar of graphics approach in this lab but, if you are interested, [Seaborn objects](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/objects_interface.html) are a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A.3 Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisations used in data science can often be classified as distributional or relational. Distributional visualisations show the distribution of a certain variable (or several variables), which can help understand important statistics such as the mean, median, mode, and variance. Relational visualisations illustrate how different variables relate to each other. Seaborn differentiates explicitly between these two groups of visualisations and also introduces a third category of categorical visualisations, which involve a categorical variable on one axis. Categorical visualisations can again be distributional or relational, but sometimes need a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three types of visualisation are created with `sns.distplot()`, `sns.relplot()`, and `sns.catplot()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these plots accept similar arguments, starting with the data, then a column name (in quotation marks) for each of the aspects of the plot that we want to map to a variable. For example, to map the columns `variable1` and `variable2` in a dataframe `df` to the x and y axis, we might write something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sns.___plot(       # Here ___ could be dist, rel or cat\n",
    "    data = df,\n",
    "    x = \"variable1\",\n",
    "    y = \"variable2\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Filling in the blanks appropriately. If we had more variables we'd like to visualise in the same plot, we can try mapping them to `hue` (colour), `style` (marker style, e.g. circle, cross, triangle), and `size` (size of the points):\n",
    "```\n",
    "sns.___plot(\n",
    "    data = df,\n",
    "    x = \"variable1\",\n",
    "    y = \"variable2\",\n",

    "Boxplots (also known as box and whisker plots) are one-dimensional representations of a distribution in which the box extends from the lower (first) to the upper (third) quartile values of the data, while the line across the box represents the median. The 'whiskers', the lines extending from the box, can represent different things, as described in the [Wikipedia article on boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). By default, Matplotlib defines the end of the upper whisker as the value of the largest data point that lies within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the upper quartile, and the lower whisker as the value of the smallest data point that lies within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the lower quartile. Data points that lie outwith the whiskers are called outliers, and are represented by dots or circles."
